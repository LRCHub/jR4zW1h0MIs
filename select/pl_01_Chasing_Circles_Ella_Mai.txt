Wait before you hit me
with your words and
Make me have to look at my reflection
Telling you it's fine when it isn't
Hoping you don't notice
I've been distant
You know I hate oversharing
But I guess it's working
Know you got your ways
But I'm still gon' drive here
You're the one that knows me
Go 'head, diagnose me
'Cause when it hurts,
you know it's therapy
So I don't mind losing
my way back to myself
I would rather chase circles
Being me than somebody else
Ain't no running, no escaping
I'm gon' face me now
Chasing circles,
going 'round and 'round
Gon' face me now
Oh, I'm chasing all these circles now
(Circles)
Going in (Circles)
Going in (Circles)
Going till I find my own way out
(Circles)
Going in (Circles)
Going in (Circles)
Going in circles now (Circles)
Going in (Circles)
Said, I'm going in (Circles)
Going in circles now
All that you know about me
Would you judge me 'bout it?
Have I been too honest?
Should we talk about it?
Why is this happening?
I'm trying my hardest
Hate I'm feeling all this
But to grow
So I don't mind losing
my way back to myself
I would rather chase circles
Being me than somebody else
Ain't no running, no escaping
I'm gon' face me now
Chasing circles, going 'round, yeah
I'm gon' face me now
Oh, oh (Circles)
Going in (Circles)
Going in (Circles)
Going till I find my own way out
(Circles)
Said, I'm going in
(Going in circles)
Going in (Circles)
Going in circles now (Circles)
Oh, circles (Going in circles)
Yeah, circles
(Said, I'm going in circles)
Said, I'm going in circles now
Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah
Going in circles now
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Going in circles now
